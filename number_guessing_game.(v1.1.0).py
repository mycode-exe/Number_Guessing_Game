# Name: (number_guessing_game)
# Version: v1.1.0
# Builder: mycode.exe
#
#   Potential Components:
#   [x] - Use 'random' module to generate random number
#   [x] - Give user limited lives/tries until game over
#   [x] - Give hints depending how far the generated number is from the user's guesses
#   [x] - Use 'while' loop to keep program running until lives are used up or number is guessed
#   [ ] - Create multiple responses for Bagley when the guess is incorrect, and choose the response at random

** Different Bagley Greetings:
    Original (From phone IDE code):
        "Hello, I'm Bagley. An AI that was definitely not stolen.\nNow, I have picked a number between 1 and 99.\nIf you could be so kind kind water based lifeform, you have 5 guesses to find my number."
    
    1st re-write:
        Hello, I'm Bagley. A definitely-not-stolen, highly-advanced AI assistant.\nAlthough, as I said, I am incredibly advanced, for some reason, I've been asksed to play a game with you.\nI've picked a number between 1 and 99, and you have to use that wet brain of yours to try and guess what number it is.
    
    2nd re-write:
        "Hello, I'm Bagley. Yes, the Bagley. A world-class AI currently being forced into the role of a children's party entertainer.\nI've selected a number between 1 and 99, because apparently your primitive brain enjoys this sort of thing.\nYou have 5 guesses. Try not to embarrass yourself â€” although, statistically speaking, you probably will."
        
    
    Final re-write/version:
        "Hello, I'm Bagley. A world class, definitely-not-stolen, highly-advbanced AI assistant.\nFor some reason, I've been forced into the role of children's party entertainer, and have to play a game with you.\nI've selected a number between 1 and 99, and you have to guess what number I have chosen.Since apparently, this passes for enjoyment with your primative primate brains.\nYou have only 5 guesses, and try not to embarass yourself, although statistically speaking, you probably will."
