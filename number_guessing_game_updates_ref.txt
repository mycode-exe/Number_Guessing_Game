Update Notes (taken from notes section at bottom of code):
    
    (v1.1.1);
        - Adding the responses was a fairly easy addition, but getting the timing on the loop seems to be the sticking point. As it shows the 5th try response as the loop ends.
        - I realised I worded the message for the 5th attempt wrong, so it wouldn't fit in the loop. And I also realised that I needed to add a 'and lives_left > 0' to the end of the higher/lower arguement so the text didn't print to screen if the player had already lost.
        - I decided to also add different win & lose state responses, just to add to the extra flavour
        - The next update will likely be a fix of the higher/lower arguement, as it doesn't seem to give accurate guidance to the user with some numbers generated. Likely due to how the num_diff is calculated and then passed to the bank of 'if' statements.

    (v1.1.2);
        - Upon investigation in code testing area, "higher/lower hint", the subtraction from one from the other could sometimes lead to a negative number, making the 'if' bank to assign the 'num_hint' to not work properly
        - Had issues for the 'if' bank around the 'num_hint' working, but seemed to be down to greater-than & less-than symbols being the wrong way around to cause the 'if' statements to fire correctly
        - Added short piece of code to display the player's past guesses
        - Next update: Add specific 'win_responses' dependent on how many lives the player had used before getting the correct answer
